# Setup and Run
You should just be able to open the html file in a browser and you are good to go!

# What's already here
I set up the structure for the project with a basic bar chart. More bars can be added fairly easily, you just need to create a new instance of Chart bar with the correct id. This class handles putting values into the fields on the left and connects them to a bar (need to add validation shown in the project.). I've also implemented a system which could easily be expanded upon to track the marker placement and map it to an integer between 0 and 10.

# Notes!
Currently I have it set up to only do bar chart functionality for debugging. At the bottom of the js file just swap the init function.

The markers and other bars still need to be tied together, that wouldn't take me long (like 30 min) once I know everything we need so just gimme those deets

IMPORTANT: Eventually we will need to serve this from HTTPS since webcam is only available from secure sites.
